### My schtick: Crank out minmally edited genuine videos that parallels mys day-to-day work

- Zero-in on an interesting topic every day or two
- Write about it here and get it down to the essense
- Create more genuine and in-context videos than most alternatives

### Video 1:
The topic I want/need to get in this morning is Graphics on WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Sept 2020, Microsoft announced supporting this natively. Do I still do the video? Yes!
https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-graphical-apps-coming-to-windows-subsystem-for-linux/

- Linux-side, it's another thing to put in .bash_profile / easily undone
  - Demonstrate cat /etc/resolv.conf (to get IP of WSL instance on VLAN)
  - Demonstrate the magic of Unix pipes (cat | grep | awk)
  - export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0

- Windows-side, it's:
  - Download & Install VcXSrv
  - Find and launch xlaunch.exe (to make config file)
  - Settings (changes from default): 
    - Multiple windows
    - Dispay number: 0
    - Start with no client
    - Saving into C:\Users\mikle\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

- Sudo apt-get install x11-apps
  - xeyes
  - xclock
  - xcalc

- sudo apt-get install chromium-browser (as a bonus?)
  (ended up being a Chrome install from .deb download)





### Video 2:

- GitHub & ssh-keygen
- Another edit

### Make editing Windows Terminal settings with Linux vim easy (like it is with VSCode)

TODO
- Edit the long vim command to edit settings.json into .bash_profile (just type settings)
- Hide tab on Windows Terminal by default (for focus mode / demo Ctrl+Shift+T)
  "alwaysShowTabs": false
  "showTabsInTitlebar": false

- Make font big and a cursor green box (as opposed to beam)
  "fontSize" : 20,
  "cursorColor" : "#FFFF00",
  "cursorShape" : "filledBox"

- Add Anaconda prompt to Microsoft Terminal
  - %windir%\System32\cmd.exe "/K" C:\Users\mikle\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat C:\Users\mikle\Anaconda3
  - From PowerShell New-Guid

- Put my .vimrc on new Ubuntu
- Linux Graphical Subsystem using an X-Server (for Windows)
- OBS & Livestreaming
- Install VSCode (don't walk away from power)

### Update your To-Do List

Uh Oh! Better make it a repo! Introduce the nice folks to git.

You have Linux access to the Windows filesystem after all.

You don't even need the Windows version of git (or vim) now.

Ugh, people want that Linux graphics subsystem video.

I also know that's what the YouTube algorithm will reward.

But do I care?

Am I one of them hyperbolic, bomastic and borish SEOs of the YouTube space?

No! No, I'm not.

So y'all can wait a video or two before I'm making googly X-Eyes at you again.

Go back up this journal as a new git repo. Do Github later (because of complexity of keys).

Use vim to change default of Windows Terminal to Ubuntu. Move guid to default.

But where? Now with no VSCode installed, we pay the penalty. Go on the hunt...

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\ [Windows Terminal blah blah] \LocalState\settings.json
/mnt/c/Users/mikle/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.WindowsTerminalPreview_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState/settings.json

1. Make fullscreen "launchMode": "maximized"
2. Set fontsize
3. Turn off tabs "alwaysShowTabs" : false
4. Default to Ubuntu "defaultProfile" : "{ [guid of Ubuntu] }",

Install my .vimrc (from Github)

Love-worthy
Choose doing it OVER other things in life
Gamification of Tech to lead you down the path to company-dependency (never stop paying)
Alternative path that uses all the same habit-building tricks that leads you down the path of FOSS
Love-worthy FOSS
To promote happiness
Adreliline, Dopamine, Seratonin 
Feeding human needs
Hunting tools of the modern information age
That don't in-turn rule you
Tool selection today will rule your future
Don't make yourself dependent on the wrong tools.

### Happy President's Day

### Video 1: Ubuntu Uninstall & Reinstall
Uninstall the upgraded Ubuntu 20.04 and reinstall a fresh one, given the new WSL 2 default.

Current one was installed under WSL 1.
I had to upgrade it after activating Windows VM-mode.
But now I can demonstrate a fresh install of a WSL2 version of Ubuntu 2 from MS Store.

### Video 2: Install Windows Terminal / Demonstrate the "VSCode Trap"

History: Teletype macines, TTY Terminals, VT100, telnet, SSH, blah, blah, blah.

So far, we've avoided VSCode on our machine... demonstrate.
But the benefits of the unified interface to terminals in Windows makes it worth it.
How does an "Old School" tool like Terminal land you VSCode on your machine?

Just watch.

- Install Windows Terminal from Microsoft Store (choose version)
- Demonstrate Tabs, in general
- Show Preferences... BAM!

The VSCode trap.

Under Globals, set
"launchMode":"maximized",
"alwaysShowTabs" : false,

Change your default profile to Ubuntu.

Launch Ubuntu.

Show ls -la

Demonstrate the explorer.exe . trick. Put ~/ on Windows quickstart.

Create a .bash_profile and put alias open="explorer.exe ." in it.

cd into root and find your way to Windows home.

Add that path as an alias to .bash_profile too.

Echo into or touch a file to show it being created from Linux side and appearing in Windows side.

Thank the nice people and say goodbye.

### Happy Valentine's Day / Video 2: 

Whether you're an actual software developer, or a casual programs-for-work coder like me,
when platforms go obsolute, so do you if you haven't hoped off of it onto the next platform du jour.
You will think fads are trends and get suckered into a soul-sucking young person's game.
This is fine when you're young, but when things are supposed to always be getting easier for you, 
this can be a problem. Well, there's some tech that won. You can bank on it in the long term.

I made a lot of tech platform choice mistakes.
Whoa was me, boo hoo.
We don't get fooled again.
Don't get fooled again, no, no

So I went on a hunt... when I was about 40 years old.
- First, I found Linux.
- Second, I found Python. 
- Third, I found vim (and git).

Microsoft knows this.
- First, they built-in Linux.
- Second, they hired the creator of Python.
- Third, they bought Github (and wrote VSCode)     ...not the actual order they did it.

And so in the spirit of bringing all the benefit of my work and theirs to you, I present to you...

How to install Linux on Windows 10.

Warning: this is the less than satisfying type-in style Linux (a.k.a. a headless server)

I'll show you how to add graphics support with an X-Windows server.

### Happy Valentine's Day

Loving and being loved is important, and it's okay to celebrate it.
If you are feeling disconnected, then come learn Python with me.

### Video 1: JupyterLabs on a Keyboard Shortcut
 
It's time to start forming your muscle memory.
You could at this point do it around VSCode.
That's what most people would do.
I propose another way that lets you just start "thinking in Python".
When it comes to your actual text editor for life, I'e got another story to tell.
But for today, it's really about making reaching for Python 
for learning or answer vquestions extremely natural and easy... an odd sort of habit.

When last we left off, I installed Anaconda with Python 3.8 on 64 Bit Windows.
I ran Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab and did the "Hello World" program on each.
And I realized how much easier Jupyter Notebook was to find and run. We fix.

Whatever Anaconda did for Notebooks is good enough for Lab. Let's go find out...

C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\python.exe C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\cwp.py C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3 C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\python.exe C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\jupyter-notebook-script.py "%USERPROFILE%/"
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\python.exe C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\cwp.py C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3 C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\python.exe C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\jupyter-lab-script.py "%USERPROFILE%/"

Placeholder before vim. Vim is the text editor for life.
Just as I'm in Notepad right now, use the right and available tool for the job.
Sometimes that's your 80/20-rule native programming language (muscle memory)
Sometimes it's not.

- I am on version 1909 of Windows. Upgrade!
  - WSL2 probably not possible without
  - 2021-02 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1909 for x64-based Systems (KB5001028)
  - This upgrade a priority because I want this journal in my old VIM environment
  - Stared the download. This'll take awhile. Also download Anaconda!

%windir%\System32\cmd.exe "/K" C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3

I would like an Anaconda prompt on my unified Microsoft Terminal please.

Okay, the Anaconda install video went very well. I was able to do the whole install
on screen capture without having to pause recording. Anaconda seems smaller. 
It certainly seems different now that they went commercial license. Hmmm, next step? WSL2 (the big one)?

### Doing the Easiest Python Install on Windows 10 in Early 2021

Make video about the 3 good paths to Python on Windows 10 

1. Easiest & most offical, but difficult for the beginner (Command Prompt / Microsoft store)
2. Best for the beginner, but not official and big download (Anaconda)
3. Best overall, on Linux... Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

Demonstrate path #1. Done.

Important concepts about daily journal:
1. It will be a git repo, probably a private one on Github
   - It will be with you your entire life
   - You can keep your journal on multiple machines
2. It's always loaded. 
   - It's always full-screen on your 1st Virtual Desktop
   - It's in a fixed position and you always know where to find it
   - It's your way of maintaining human statefulness
